RED: code that simply does not work / compile
// Error - This code is throwing a specific reproducible error.
// Broken - This code is broken and will not run.
// WTF - WHAT THE FRIG.

ORANGE: code that works but is not right
// Hack - This code has intentionally been hacked in order to work. Should not go into production.
// FixMe - This code works but could be better. Needs better abstraction, maintainability, performance, etc.
// Bug - This code works and was expected to be right but a bug has been found. (usually flagged post production)
// Review - This code is probably right but should be reviewed for piece of mind.
// Smells - Same as FixMe

BLUE: code that works but either needs more features or more explaining
// Todo - Functionality is not yet implemented
// Note - Better explain what's going on. This is gives a higher profile to standard comments, and allows notes to be found in the to-do pane
